                        energy for tomorrow.
                        We are a leading generator of renewable electricity and one of the largest electricity network
                        companies in the UK.
                        We develop, own and operate low carbon infrastructure to support the zero-carbon transition.
                        This includes onshore and offshore wind, hydro power, electricity transmission and distribution
                        grids, and efficient gas-fired generation, alongside providing energy products and services for
                        businesses, and we have interests across Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Republic of

                        and
                        Ireland, with a growing presence internationally.
                        We have an operational portfolio of around 4GW of onshore wind, offshore wind and hydro
                        generation,
                        with
                        a secured future project pipeline of over 13GW in development.

                    <p>
                        Our operational portfolio comprises nearly 2GW of onshore wind capacity, almost 0.5GW of
                        offshore
                        wind
                        capacity, and almost 1.5GW of flexible hydro power and pumped storage capacity. These generation
                        assets
                        produce around 10TWh of renewable power each year.
                        We're committed to delivering the green energy the world needs now and in the future. Our 13GW+
                        construction and development pipeline includes 3.5GW of onshore wind, 1.5GW of pumped storage,
                        and
                        8.4GW
                        of offshore wind energy - the largest offshore development pipeline in the UK and Ireland.

                        SSE Renewables’ purpose is to deliver it.
                        SSE Renewables is building more offshore wind than any other company in the world. We have set a
                        goal to double our current renewable generation capacity to 8GW by 2026 and more than triple
                        capacity to 13GW by 2031. This increase is expected to result in SSE Renewables generating at
                        least 50TWh of renewable energy output by the end of the next decade, a fivefold increase from
                        2019 levels.
