<h3>
<b>What is the Climate Action Group?</b>
</h3>
<p>
Over 60 of our Partners and their suppliers are collaborating through the Supply Chain Sustainability School
to meet their ambitious scienced-based targets and work towards net zero.
</p>
<p>
Our aim is to drive a reduction in carbon emissions from the built environment. To make this possible, we need
the support and engagement of the supply chain to start reporting their carbon performance through the Carbon
Tool.
